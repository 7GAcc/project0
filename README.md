Hello. This website consists of 4 webpages. The theme of this website is me! The first page, index.html briefly summarizes things I like to do. The other three webpages further explain a few of these things. First, I give an example of a car I do and don't like, as well as the reasons why in car.html. Next, I tell you my favorite foods and drinks in food.html. Next, the videogames.html webpage goes over video games I enjoy playing. 
There are also 3 additional files. The first is styles.css, which is simply the styles used before the introduction to Sass. styles2.css and styles2.scss are both essentially the same file, but in different formats. These files are basically a copy-paste of styles.css, but also contain the usage of Sass variables, nesting, and inheritence. The styles2.css file is simply a conversion of the Sass file, styles2.scss, to CSS. All three were kept to show the differences. These differences will also be seen in the webpages.
