    <h1> Good Cars and Bad Cars </h1>
    <p> 
      There are lots of things to look at when you decide what car you want to buy. In most instances, you will have some sort of bias towards a specfic brand, country, feature, or even color. Keeping this in mind, here are some of my opinions on cars.

    <h2> Good Cars </h2>
    <p> 
      When I look at a car, in most cases, I treat reliability as the most important factor. After all, what is the point of owning a car if it spends most of its time in a shop? 
      The most reliable cars, by far, are made by Toyota. The most obvious example of this is the Toyota Corolla. The biggest drawback of these used to be their looks, but I think the newer models actually don't look too bad. Here is a picture of one:

    <h2> Bad Cars </h2>
    <p> 
      As I said before, I value reliability. It would make sense that a car that isn't reliable would be a bad car. For this reason I have to give this award to none other than Land Rover's Range Rover. Having worked at an auto shop, I know how bad these cars can be. When these cars leave their period of warranty, they also find a new home in the parking lot of your mechanic's shop. You begin to realize that your mechanic is spending more time with that car than you are. This is mainly due to the poor quality of materials Range Rovers have inside of them, as well as the poor engineering when compared to other cars of the same category. However, they do look better than Corollas, as you can see below:
