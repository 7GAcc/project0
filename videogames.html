      <h1> Video Games </h1>
      <p> Considering that we have been in the midst of a pandemic for nearly the past two years, it has been recommended for everyone to stay indoors. During breaks, I like to play video games for the following reasons: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> To pass time </li>
        <li> To relieve stress </li>
        <li> To do something with friends </li>
        <li> To have fun </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> My Favorite Games </h2>
      <p> I have owned only a few systems that I could play video games on and I haven't played an extensive amount of games. For each of the systems I've used, I have the following favorites: </p>
